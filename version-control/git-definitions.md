# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

answer: version control is like time travel; a snapshot of history. If you make something new and it breaks your code you can easily rollback to a previous state of the project.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

answer:  a branch is like a sideproject for your main project. you want to use it so that you can easily separate the different areas of your project. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

answer: a commit is like saving a history snapshot. A good commit message should be relevant and descriptive of what you're saving/committing.

* What is a merge conflict?

answer: A merge conflict is when you're trying to merge two branches and they have changes contradicting each other. Like if on branch1 you wrote some code on line 3 and in branch2 you wrote something different on line 3. the merge cant happen without hurting the code from one of the branches so it sends a merge conflict message and shows where the problem is.
