## Learning jQuery

I intend to read the docs for most part of the 2 hours. The concepts I find more  interesting or useful I will try to find some blogs or articles about. I will make a .js file to test code and add notes to the code purpose. 

### -------------------------

I didn't even get to the point of looking things up outside of the jqueryui.com docs, and didn't have time to look at the standard jquery.com docs... I did manage to make a sample page with html and jquery though.
